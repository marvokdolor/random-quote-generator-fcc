## Random Quote Generator - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.

This is a work in progress so in the coming weeks you'll see:
- [x] A [link](https://marvokdolor.github.io/random-quote-generator-fcc/) to this app deployed to GitHub-pages. [Reference](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089)
- [x] Better design using Bootstrap

If you're curious about my freeCodeCamp work please check out my [portfolio](https://codepen.io/marvokdolor/full/bmLbQy/) currently on CodePen, but moving to GitHub-pages in the coming months.
