## Random Quote Generator - [freeCodeCamp Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

I heavily borrowed from the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/).
I also used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to make the set up easier.

This is a work in progress so in the coming weeks you'll see:
- [ ] A link to this app deployed to GitHub-pages
- [ ] Better design using Bootstrap

If you're curious about my freeCodeCamp work please check out my [portfolio](https://codepen.io/marvokdolor/full/bmLbQy/) currently on CodePen, but moving to GitHub-pages in the coming months.
